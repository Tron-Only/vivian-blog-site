*A static blog so smooth, even your grandma could run it (but it's built for my cool aunt).*

## ✨ Features  
- **Blazing fast** ⚡ (No WordPress bloat here!)  
- **Aunt-approved CMS** ✏️ (Decap CMS makes editing *stupid simple*)  
- **100% Free** 🤑 (Hosted on Netlify, because budgets matter)  
- **Responsive AF** 📱 (Looks good on a potato screen)  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- [Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/) - Static site wizardry  
- [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/) - So easy, Aunt Vivian won’t call you for tech support  
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - For hosting and auto-deploys (aka magic)  
- HTML/CSS - Old school, but it works (Kevin Powell would approve)  

## 🏗️ How to Steal... Err, *Use* This  
1. **Clone this repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tron-Only/vivian-blog-site.git
   ```
2. **Install the goodies**  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run it locally**  
   ```bash
   npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
   ```
4. **Customize**  
   - Edit `src/admin/config.yml` to tweak the CMS.  
   - Replace `src/posts/*.md` with your aunt’s wisdom(Or when you deploy it use the www.randomdomain.xxx/admin to use the CMS).  

## 🤔 Why This Exists  
Because my aunt wanted a blog site, and I refused to install WordPress(Personal Hatred). Mission accomplished.
